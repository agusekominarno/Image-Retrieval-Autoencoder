# Image retrieval using Autoencoder

![Result](image/result.png)

## Abstract
The demand for image retrieval research has surged due to the proliferation of visual data online. Traditional content-based searches are hindered by high data dimensionality and the semantic gap in image understanding. This study utilizes Autoencoders, a type of deep learning model that simplifies visual data into more manageable formats, to enhance image search efficiency. Focusing on the culturally significant Batik Nitik 960 dataset, the research tackles pattern recognition challenges, crafting a model that encodes images for easier retrieval based on visual similarities. Findings reveal Autoencoders' capacity for sophisticated data analysis, beneficial for e-commerce, education, and heritage conservation, underscoring the role of technology in preserving and promoting cultural heritage.
